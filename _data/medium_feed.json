But our goal isn\u2019t just to release AI products into the field; we aim to make a tangible impact. This journey began in 2020, when we forged a strategic partnership with Straumann Group, a global leader in tooth replacement and orthodontic solutions. This partnership recently achieved a significant milestone: launching a quarterly innovation event across the Group called <strong>Inno\u00a0Week</strong>.</p>\n<p>In this post I will explain the motivation behind this, the benefits we already see, the challenges we had to overcome and the things we would do differently.</p>\n<h3>Innovation is in our\u00a0DNA</h3>\n<p>Straumann\u2019s journey began in 1954 as a family business with a strong pioneering spirit, a commitment to science and a desire for innovation and change. The company had grown into a collection of businesses, and amongst them dental implants. Today the Straumann Group hosts numerous brands that extend beyond implantology into various areas of dental innovation.</p>\n<p>Straumann has built a reputation of advancing dentistry through innovation: if today you are facing implant treatment your safest and most reliable choice is unquestionably the Straumann family of implants. Straumann Group continues to define industry standards in dental implant and restorative design, and over the years extended more and more into the digital side of dentistry with sophisticated softwares like <a href=\"https://www.straumann.com/en/dental-professionals/products-and-solutions/cares-digital-solutions/software/codiagnostix.html\">coDiagnostix</a> or services like <a href=\"https://www.straumann.com/en/dental-professionals/products-and-solutions/cares-digital-solutions/services-and-solutions/smile-in-a-box.html\">Smile in a\u00a0Box</a>.</p>\n<p>However, <strong>as a company grows the way to foster innovation also has to change</strong>. While in a 10-person startup, good ideas are easier picked up and brought into the roadmap, a &gt;11.000 people company works differently: executives have to oversee changes of a much larger scale and be much more careful with taking risky bets. This is why strong corporations have <a href=\"https://www.straumann.com/group/en/home/about/our-business/innovation.html\">established processes</a> to nurture truly novel\u00a0ideas.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0vhP8YOKRZvx_XVltxRU3w.png\"><figcaption>Fostering innovation requires a good balance between encouraging risky bets and managing\u00a0risks</figcaption></figure><p>Straumann already runs a solid <a href=\"https://www.straumann.com/group/en/home/about/our-business/innovation.html\">innovation program</a> to foster ideas that have a chance for a big impact from inception to prototype. At the same time we felt that we could help the very early steps of innovation even more, for two\u00a0reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are innovations that may lack the potential for industry-wide impact but would make people\u2019s (employees or users) work or life\u00a0easier.</li>\n<li>Giving a little bit of extra room for an early experiment on a product innovation can help the innovators to build a much better defined case for their\u00a0idea.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Luckily, such initiatives have already been independently implemented in some sites: Montreal, Chemnitz and in our team too. And since these brought some quite visible success stories (you can read about one that we liked very much <a href=\"https://blog.promaton.com/point-cloud-registration-using-fully-convolutional-geometric-features-fa1c1b2627b7\">here</a>), two brave site leads (Bas Verheij (Promaton) and Claude Sasseville (Montreal)) could make the proposal to introduce this format in the entire digital arm of Straumann Group, which has several hundred employees.</p>\n<p>On top of the above two points, performing such an introduction has the potential to bring in a third benefit too, which\u00a0is:</p>\n<ul><li>Cross-pollination between teams and departments. Even if you haven\u2019t been working in a big company, you could probably imagine how difficult it could be to get to know people, processes and products outside of your day-to-day connections.</li></ul>\n<p>And this is where my involvement as CTO of Promaton\u00a0started.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-AXwJWY01bWcvgo2G0SS4w.png\"><figcaption>Improving early stage innovation has three key\u00a0benefits</figcaption></figure><h3>You just have to implement it,\u00a0right?</h3>\n<p>One could\u00a0think:</p>\n<blockquote>\u201cSo you had two implementations already; just take the best of both worlds and kick it off. Bamm! Success!\u201d</blockquote>\n<p>Well, it\u2019s not that easy. First of all an organizing committee was created, consisting of Mathieu Guindon (Straumann Montreal), Julien Marbach (Straumann Montreal) and me, with the task to define how the Inno Week should look. We all had useful learnings from previous implementations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We saw that both of our versions attracted lots of very creative ideas. The key was to really let people come up with their own innovations, be that improving a product or a process or even just learning about a cool new\u00a0idea.</li>\n<li>We also saw that bringing novel ideas to the roadmap required lots of effort. So we wanted to make sure that with the bigger implementation, we had well-defined processes to support\u00a0that.</li>\n<li>We also saw that engaging people, mentoring, detailed reviews and different prizes (e.g. Best Clinical or Most Visionary) mean that such an Inno Week concept is much more than just a kickoff presentation. We had to think about how to extend the group of organizers and which \u201cfeatures\u201d of the previous implementations we really wanted to\u00a0keep.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We also looked at implementations at other companies and learned from their insights too. Some quite interesting formats to support innovation are (or were in the past) the <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/company/shipit\">Atlassian ShipIt</a>, <a href=\"https://abc.xyz/investor/founders-letters/ipo-letter/\">Google\u2019s 20% rule</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/1998/01/the-15-percent-solution/\">3M 15%</a> solution.</p>\n<p>After some iterations involving Bas and Claude too, we arrived at a presentation that, on one slide, explained the concept (i.e. who, when, why, what) and were ready to start pitching it to all relevant stakeholders. Even though we had the top management\u2019s buy-in, we still had to make sure that everyone understood the benefits of doing the Inno Week, since the cost (i.e. 1 week is diverted from the <a href=\"https://scaledagileframework.com/\">program increment</a> delivery) was\u00a0clear.</p>\n<p>Our pitch was the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Goal</strong>: testing, proving &amp; pitching new ideas with rapid prototypes, cross-pollination of knowledge &amp; skills, make sure we are at the forefront of digital innovation!</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Participation</strong>: anyone in the organization can participate, but please make sure you have managerial approval before the Inno\u00a0Week.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Topics</strong>: Inno Week topics can be either rapid prototyping, process improvement, or research on a hypothesis. Projects can be performed in a team or individually.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Results</strong>: each team or individual participating in the Inno Week should end with a demo (preferred), presentation (max 10 slide) or a video (max 3 min) of their results, this should be submitted to be considered for evaluation &amp;\u00a0rewards.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Governance</strong>: Inno Week is governed by the Innovation Committee and executed with the help of ambassadors who support participants &amp; champion innovation culture in the different locations.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GkXM6gYSntU6k1siBOrAnw.png\"><figcaption>The 5 keys to a successful Inno\u00a0Week</figcaption></figure><p>This way, we clarified that the goal is not only direct innovation but also indirectly facilitating innovation by building bridges between teams that otherwise wouldn\u2019t work together. On the participation side, we made sure that managers are an active part of the journey by giving them an overview of who is participating from their teams and the option to keep critical things in progress if needed. We made sure that it\u2019s clear that while there are little limitations on the topics we have clear expectations on the outcome formats. This way people focus on reaching a presentable state by the end of the week. Finally, we started mapping the people who are committed to innovation in the different teams and onboarded them as ambassadors or asked them to join as organizers (this is how the great Albrecht Schnappauf joined us with his 30+ years in tangible innovation).</p>\n<h3>The first run of the new\u00a0concept</h3>\n<p>The first iteration of the Inno Week was scheduled for the final week of the Q1 2024 program increment, just before the planning of the next quarter. We advertised it in the Software and Tech All Hands meeting, we connected with the overall Straumann innovation initiatives, we made sure that all questions were promptly answered and then we embraced for Monday, 18 Mar 2024, when the first run commenced. I was nervous that week because the stakes were high; we asked for one week from everyone, in return for bringing bottom-up innovations to processes and products.</p>\n<p>Luckily, we had quite promising signals: people submitted more than 80 ideas, and more than 250 colleagues checked them out, engaging in different ways: likes, upvotes and comments. This meant we had quite a good chance of booking some success already in the first iteration because one thing we were sure of: we were going to learn a lot about what we would have to change in the next iteration. Probably the most important highlights are the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We managed to involve <strong>almost all of the sites</strong> in the first iteration! Due to the timing (doing the Inno Week just before the planning of the next quarter) some teams opted for finishing their quarters rather than trying out this new\u00a0format.</li>\n<li>We had some quite visible <strong>collaboration between sites,</strong> providing clear evidence of effective cross-pollination. I myself was even collaborating with a team I didn\u2019t know beforehand, this helped me a lot in understanding better what kind of different experts are working in other\u00a0sites.</li>\n<li>We had a few <strong>extremely promising projects</strong> that fitted perfectly the Group-wide innovation program, so we started preparing them together with the teams for a submission.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There were also some lowlights that we had to think\u00a0about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>timing</strong> of the first Inno Week was not ideal. Before the PI planning, everybody is still in the crazy last push to meet the goals. In this context, the Inno Week could come across as a distraction, so we had to work with the software portfolio management team to get a better timing for the next iterations.</li>\n<li>Our <strong>onboarding of the ambassadors</strong> was not perfect. Some of them said they weren\u2019t sure about what they should do, and a few of them admitted that they didn\u2019t get the concept clear either. While we did our best, we learned that you should never underestimate the difficulty of communicating something in a simple narrative so everyone understands it.</li>\n<li>Our communication about the aim and definition of the Inno Week was not clear enough in some areas of the <a href=\"https://erinmeyer.com/books/the-culture-map/\">culture map</a>. Some cultures would participate to win prizes, some simply to try out new things, for others the idea of bottom-up innovation does not come naturally. This means, again, that we had to be very clear with our communication and, for some sites, do additional onboarding sessions.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NAEjCwrbBiaG1RiO18cj-A.png\"><figcaption>Reflection on the first Inno\u00a0Week</figcaption></figure><p>Three highlights and three lowlights, so was it a success? We were introducing a new concept, so the most important KPI for us was to have enough traction/success for this first iteration to make a second iteration possible. And that was clearly there. As a matter of fact, I\u2019m writing this during the third iteration when I chose this blog post as my\u00a0project.</p>\n<h3>An environment that fosters innovation</h3>\n<p>Now, almost one year after we started working on the implementation of the Inno Week, we see it as a stable part of our culture. There are some solid successes fueling it; both with building bridges between teams and with product enhancements already being rolled out to users of our digital portfolio. We also see many smaller daily reminders of the benefits of bottom-up innovation, like an easier request form, a more stable CI, or an updated tooling. We are still not at the point where everyone is participating in the Inno Week, but ultimately, it\u2019s not the goal either. The aim is to provide a format that allows ideas to be tested quickly and learn from people you would otherwise not necessarily meet. These small things make big companies enjoy some of the most important benefits of smaller startups, while also having the resources and maturity to make a stable global\u00a0impact.</p>\n<p>On a more personal side, I\u2019m proud that this crucial component of Promaton\u2019s culture is flowing into the culture of Straumann Group. It\u2019s a good thing and it fueled so many of our innovations, so it is amazing to see it working now on a much bigger scale too. Obviously, this couldn\u2019t be done without the support of key members of the Executive Management Board of Straumann (Thomas Friese and Florian Kirsch) and without the hard work and dedication of Mathieu, Julien, Claude and Bas (see\u00a0above).</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=585c2721de17\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.promaton.com/the-power-of-a-single-week-dedicated-to-innovation-585c2721de17\">The Power of a Single Week Dedicated to Innovation</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://blog.promaton.com/\">Promaton</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n","content":"\n<h4>How learnings from our growth and hack week helped kick off Inno Week at Straumann Group</h4>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*iZCrbyLpd6-kCpgc\"><figcaption>Straumann has built a reputation of advancing dentistry through innovation.

With the following 10-minute read, I\u2019d like to save you three months of work. That was the time I invested in writing those strategies, and although I learned a lot, I wish someone had told me what I\u2019m about to share with\u00a0you.</p>\n<h3>Why Is It So Difficult to Write a Strategy?</h3>\n<p>One of my first tasks as a CTO was to write an engineering strategy. I learned about our business, our technology, and the competitive landscape, and then wrote down an amazing vision of where we should go. The document was well-structured (i.e., it had three strategic pillars), featured all the buzzwords, and I was proud of\u00a0myself.</p>\n<p>However, when I presented it to the CEO, he was not impressed. He told me that it should be connected to the company and product strategies instead of being a standalone document. I didn\u2019t understand this comment because I thought I had done exactly\u00a0that.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I revised the document and paid extra attention to connecting it to the product strategy. I included all the capabilities we discussed in meetings so the strategy wouldn\u2019t have blind spots. When I felt ready, I showed it to the CEO\u2026 who was again unimpressed. His comment this time was that he missed tangible actions on what we should do. I was clueless again; I spent entire pages describing where we should be with the specific capabilities we have in one year. He acknowledged that but still felt this was not the holy\u00a0grail.</p>\n<p>So I started again, this time from scratch. I\u2019ve read <a href=\"https://lethain.com/eng-strategies/\">Will Larson\u2019s</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42414767-technology-strategy-patterns\">Eben Hewitt\u2019s</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44144493-fundamentals-of-software-architecture\">Mark Richards\u2019</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33369254-the-manager-s-path\">Camille Fournier\u2019s</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11721966-good-strategy-bad-strategy\">Richard Rumelt\u2019s</a> guidelines. You know, I\u2019m the kind of person who, once he sets his mind to something, leaves no stone unturned in his efforts to accomplish it. And I was sure this time I was going to ace it. I looked at each of the things in motion, selected the ones that would lead us to the Promised Land, and wrote them down. I also learned from my mistake of writing a 12-page monster last time and wrote only 6 pages with lots of bullet points. I was ready to present it and collect the\u200a\u2014\u200aby this time, really well-deserved\u200a\u2014\u200aapplause, flowers, and whatever authors of good strategy documents get.</p>\n<p>But I didn\u2019t get any of those; instead, the CEO noted that it\u2019s again a step in the right direction but lacks the overarching narrative and, more importantly, how we are going to address our most important challenges. I was devastated.</p>\n<blockquote>I just couldn\u2019t understand how I could have failed at it three times and why it is so difficult to write a good strategy.</blockquote>\n<h3>Because You Have to Draw\u00a0It</h3>\n<p>Amidst my desperation, I came across a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcp6YMAmI3M\">talk from Simon Wardley</a>, creator of the Wardley maps. He started by describing his first strategy which was full of buzzwords and led nowhere. I felt he was describing mine. Then he showed how maps differ from graphs. It clicked immediately. I thought, \u201cOMG, I\u2019ve got the solution: it\u2019s difficult to <em>write</em> a strategy because you have to <em>draw</em> it.\u201d And then he explained Wardley maps in the remaining 40 minutes, and I immediately understood it and\u00a0felt:</p>\n<blockquote>\u201cYes! Finally! I\u2019ve got the solution to my problem! I have to create a Wardley\u00a0map\u201d</blockquote>\n<p>The whole idea is based on the notion that we have excellent visual reasoning skills in actual physical spaces where position and motion make sense. Therefore, Wardley maps use a 2D space (see Fig 1), where one dimension represents the <strong>Visibility of Value</strong> and the second one represents the <strong>Evolution of the Capability</strong>. Genius.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/567/1*gpPep-Crk_7lmViwqPJ1Pg.png\"><figcaption>Fig 1. An example value chain for an Artisan Tea House. Your main value offering could be the cup of tea, <em>whose value is supported by the prototype homemade artisan design of the cup, the well-trained staff, and commodities such as tea from a supplier. These further depend on other commodities such as cups from a ceramic maker and water from the utility provider. The connecting lines help map the value\u00a0chain.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Visibility of Value combines the actual value with its visibility; this helps resolve the conflict that often happens between engineers and salespeople: one says something is of high value, and the other says, \u201cOkay, but it is not visible.\u201d Imagine this dimension as something like the time of day: night is low visibility, and noon is high visibility. This helps explain why it\u2019s so difficult to get feedback and make things work smoothly together when they are buried deep in the value chain. At night, we have more trouble seeing the details of an object.

Another thing missing is an intuitive visualization of time.

Or are there lines which are not so well established in reality (especially, threats may not form one single \u201cthreat-chain\u201d)?

The point is not to get all your capabilities where the customer is, you just have to provide enough support for your product that it can\u00a0deliver.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>Now, you just have to figure out what you need to do in real life to make those changes in direction. These are your <strong>strategic actions</strong>.</blockquote>\n<p>Done. I call this <strong>Wardley-Torok mapping</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Let\u2019s See Some Practical Examples</h3>\n<p>My favorite is <strong>the case of feature overengineering</strong>. Let\u2019s say a manager asks an engineer to develop a feature. The engineer starts to work on it and is giving only low-level updates. Meanwhile, the manager's fear is increasing that we will run out of time before the feature works. Finally, they meet, and the manager says that there is no more time; we have to show something. Then in the presentation, it turns out that the feature has all sorts of bells and whistles but is just not doing exactly what the customer minimally wanted.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s see where strategy mapping could have helped. You can see what the engineer would have drawn at the meeting before the presentation in Fig 3.1. In his representation, there were no issues; it was just a matter of showing the great and mature product. In reality, though, despite the product\u2019s high evolution, it didn\u2019t include the features the customer needed (Fig 3.2). So the optimal choice would have been to learn what the customer actually wanted and make the necessary changes, even if that means incurring technical debt (i.e. making the product less\u00a0mature).</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*XSxPsMv1iwwv6zFBptIMkg.png\"><figcaption>Fig 3. Perception matters. On the left (1) you can see a view of the engineer working on a capability, who believes the customer wanted all the implemented features and now they have only to show the ready work. On the right (1) you see an example when this is actually overengineering, here the capability has higher evolution than the customer wanted. Here it\u2019s clear that the previous \u201cstrategy\u201d would not be the right choice. Rather, they have to learn about what the customer wanted and modify the\u00a0design.</figcaption></figure><p>You can also see that I\u2019m not talking here about the strategy of the company or the manager. Many think that strategic thinking is only required for people high up in the management ladder; I believe the opposite:</p>\n<blockquote>We need easier ways to talk about strategy so that everyone can participate in the discussion.</blockquote>\n<p>Let\u2019s think a bit more about how important is how we place things in this space. Take another <strong>example: a wrong estimate</strong>. Here your manager comes to you and asks how much it would cost to manufacture 1 million units of the prototype you\u2019ve just put together. You look at the price of putting together the prototype, divided it by two (i.e., economies of scale), multiply by a million, and say that it\u2019s probably in that ballpark. Your manager forwards it to her manager without too much thinking, and you both consider the job done. However, at the next meeting, you find yourself in a crisis meeting because it turned out that you just killed the product before even launching it as the company can never make a profit at scale with these\u00a0numbers.</p>\n<p>Now, depending on how you represent the threat, the chosen actions will differ. If you perceive (see Fig 4) the wrong estimate as an evolved (x-axis) and highly visible (y-axis) threat that indicates a substantial chance that the product would not scale, you might be tempted to go ahead and optimize it, cut costs, and ensure that you release something that would scale. The cost of this is that you waste time and miss your early adopters, who would have been happy to buy it even at a higher price or would have given you enough marketing so that it\u2019s worth it to lose money on the unit\u00a0price.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*CD8raGeh4n5GmO5MAvgoBQ.png\"><figcaption>Fig 4. <em>Perception primes action. On the left (1) we see a situation where the threat is perceived as quite an evolved threat with relatively high visibility, and it attracts the team\u2019s focus away from the customer\u2019s immediate needs. On the right (2) we see another representation of the situation with similar visibility but much less evolved, which requires a different action from the\u00a0team.</em></figcaption></figure><p>On the other hand, you could also see that this wrong estimate drew attention to the fears behind the scalability of the product. But at this point, you could address these fears simply by making a better estimate, without investing any work into premature optimization and committing to delays. Which perception is right? Depends on the situation.</p>\n<blockquote>Your strategy is a hypothesis for the best action based on the analysis of the situation</blockquote>\n<p>Also, you don\u2019t necessarily have to fight threats. Like in the example of Fig 5, you can simply say to the stakeholders that, yes indeed, we have concerns about the scalability of the product, but an even bigger challenge is to find product-market fit. And that\u2019s our focus with the release of the MVP to the first 1,000 users. We will deal with all other priorities later.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/567/1*cstZKC-z9cwWAnDeiZdnmw.png\"><figcaption>Fig 5. <em>Representation drives strategy choice. In the above case, one could easily see the fears about lack of scalability as addressable but still opt for delivering a \u201cnon-scalable\u201d MVP to get early customer feedback before embarking on optimization for scalability.</em></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>So What Did I Learn from My Three Failed Attempts?</strong></h3>\n<p>Now, thanks to Wardley-Torok maps, I can show <strong>exactly</strong> what the issues were with my strategies. And of course, in hindsight, it all makes perfect\u00a0sense.</p>\n<p>In the first strategy (see Fig 6), I wrote down things that are all cool and would probably be the right steps for one company or another, but I totally missed understanding our company (i.e., what our value add is to our customers).</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8nbZP9FVwACnFkb6U2lQZQ.png\"><figcaption><em>Fig 6. Simplified Wardley-Torok maps of my three strategies. Dashed lines indicate the missing components. First (1) I just wrote up all cool and shiny things but didn\u2019t understand our value offering to customers deeply enough. Then (2) I understood the value offering and described an optimal target state of our capabilities but didn\u2019t write down how to get there. Finally (3), I collected all critical parts of our value chain and indicated the forces we have in the system, but I didn\u2019t specify which strategic choices about changes of direction we have to\u00a0make.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Then in the next one, I understood that correctly and even our specific value chain, but I mostly mapped the target states and not how to get there, which is a vision and not a strategy. Then, in my last one, I correctly mapped the dynamics and in some cases recognized that we should make some fine-tunings. But without the strategic actions, I just made a good snapshot of our organization\u2019s inertia. Luckily, from here you can see that I\u2019m very close to the actual strategy; it just took three months of work to get there without the mapping I described above. So I thought I would save you some time by just showing it to\u00a0you.</p>\n<p>This model is licensed CC BY-SA\u00a04.0</p>\n<p>Visit us at <a href=\"https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/\"><em>DataDrivenInvestor.com</em></a></p>\n<p>Subscribe to DDIntel\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ddintel.com/\"><em>here</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Join our creator ecosystem <a href=\"https://join.datadriveninvestor.com/\"><em>here</em></a>.</p>\n<p>DDI Official Telegram Channel: <a href=\"https://t.me/+tafUp6ecEys4YjQ1\">https://t.me/+tafUp6ecEys4YjQ1</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/data-driven-investor\"><em>LinkedIn</em></a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@DDInvestorHQ\"><em>Twitter</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/datadriveninvestor\"><em>YouTube</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/datadriveninvestor\"><em>Facebook</em></a>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=2e6232e4578f\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/how-to-draw-a-strategy-in-4-steps-2e6232e4578f\">How to Draw a Strategy in 4 Steps</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/\">DataDrivenInvestor</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n","content":"\n<h3>How to Draw a Strategy in 4 Easy\u00a0Steps</h3>\n<h4>One strategic picture says more than a thousand strategic words</h4>\n<p>It took me writing three bad strategies before I finally started looking beyond my excuses and discovered the contours of a solution. With the following 10-minute read, I\u2019d like to save you three months of work. That was the time I invested in writing those strategies, and although I learned a lot, I wish someone had told me what I\u2019m about to share with\u00a0you.</p>\n<h3>Why Is It So Difficult to Write a Strategy?</h3>\n<p>One of my first tasks as a CTO was to write an engineering strategy. I learned about our business, our technology, and the competitive landscape, and then wrote down an amazing vision of where we should go. The document was well-structured (i.e., it had three strategic pillars), featured all the buzzwords, and I was proud of\u00a0myself.</p>\n<p>However, when I presented it to the CEO, he was not impressed. He told me that it should be connected to the company and product strategies instead of being a standalone document. I didn\u2019t understand this comment because I thought I had done exactly\u00a0that.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I revised the document and paid extra attention to connecting it to the product strategy. I included all the capabilities we discussed in meetings so the strategy wouldn\u2019t have blind spots. When I felt ready, I showed it to the CEO\u2026 who was again unimpressed. His comment this time was that he missed tangible actions on what we should do. I was clueless again; I spent entire pages describing where we should be with the specific capabilities we have in one year. He acknowledged that but still felt this was not the holy\u00a0grail.</p>\n<p>So I started again, this time from scratch. I\u2019ve read <a href=\"https://lethain.com/eng-strategies/\">Will Larson\u2019s</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42414767-technology-strategy-patterns\">Eben Hewitt\u2019s</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44144493-fundamentals-of-software-architecture\">Mark Richards\u2019</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33369254-the-manager-s-path\">Camille Fournier\u2019s</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11721966-good-strategy-bad-strategy\">Richard Rumelt\u2019s</a> guidelines. You know, I\u2019m the kind of person who, once he sets his mind to something, leaves no stone unturned in his efforts to accomplish it. And I was sure this time I was going to ace it. I looked at each of the things in motion, selected the ones that would lead us to the Promised Land, and wrote them down. I also learned from my mistake of writing a 12-page monster last time and wrote only 6 pages with lots of bullet points. I was ready to present it and collect the\u200a\u2014\u200aby this time, really well-deserved\u200a\u2014\u200aapplause, flowers, and whatever authors of good strategy documents get.</p>\n<p>But I didn\u2019t get any of those; instead, the CEO noted that it\u2019s again a step in the right direction but lacks the overarching narrative and, more importantly, how we are going to address our most important challenges. I was devastated.</p>\n<blockquote>I just couldn\u2019t understand how I could have failed at it three times and why it is so difficult to write a good strategy.</blockquote>\n<h3>Because You Have to Draw\u00a0It</h3>\n<p>Amidst my desperation, I came across a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcp6YMAmI3M\">talk from Simon Wardley</a>, creator of the Wardley maps. He started by describing his first strategy which was full of buzzwords and led nowhere. I felt he was describing mine. Then he showed how maps differ from graphs. It clicked immediately. I thought, \u201cOMG, I\u2019ve got the solution: it\u2019s difficult to <em>write</em> a strategy because you have to <em>draw</em> it.\u201d And then he explained Wardley maps in the remaining 40 minutes, and I immediately understood it and\u00a0felt:</p>\n<blockquote>\u201cYes! Finally! I\u2019ve got the solution to my problem! I have to create a Wardley\u00a0map\u201d</blockquote>\n<p>The whole idea is based on the notion that we have excellent visual reasoning skills in actual physical spaces where position and motion make sense. Therefore, Wardley maps use a 2D space (see Fig 1), where one dimension represents the <strong>Visibility of Value</strong> and the second one represents the <strong>Evolution of the Capability</strong>. Genius.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/567/1*gpPep-Crk_7lmViwqPJ1Pg.png\"><figcaption>Fig 1. An example value chain for an Artisan Tea House. Your main value offering could be the cup of tea, <em>whose value is supported by the prototype homemade artisan design of the cup, the well-trained staff, and commodities such as tea from a supplier. These further depend on other commodities such as cups from a ceramic maker and water from the utility provider. The connecting lines help map the value\u00a0chain.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Visibility of Value combines the actual value with its visibility; this helps resolve the conflict that often happens between engineers and salespeople: one says something is of high value, and the other says, \u201cOkay, but it is not visible.\u201d Imagine this dimension as something like the time of day: night is low visibility, and noon is high visibility. This helps explain why it\u2019s so difficult to get feedback and make things work smoothly together when they are buried deep in the value chain. At night, we have more trouble seeing the details of an object. Of course, if your eyes are used to the dark, you can be pretty efficient there, but a customer would have quite some trouble navigating it.</p>\n<p>Evolution is even more interesting. On the left-hand side, you have the spark that starts everything, and gradually you go through iterations to reach PoC (Proof of Concept), prototype, MVP (Minimum Viable Product), evolution, and finally become a commodity.

On the left (1) we see a situation where the threat is perceived as quite an evolved threat with relatively high visibility, and it attracts the team\u2019s focus away from the customer\u2019s immediate needs. On the right (2) we see another representation of the situation with similar visibility but much less evolved, which requires a different action from the\u00a0team.</em></figcaption></figure><p>On the other hand, you could also see that this wrong estimate drew attention to the fears behind the scalability of the product. But at this point, you could address these fears simply by making a better estimate, without investing any work into premature optimization and committing to delays. Which perception is right? Depends on the situation.</p>\n<blockquote>Your strategy is a hypothesis for the best action based on the analysis of the situation</blockquote>\n<p>Also, you don\u2019t necessarily have to fight threats. Like in the example of Fig 5, you can simply say to the stakeholders that, yes indeed, we have concerns about the scalability of the product, but an even bigger challenge is to find product-market fit. And that\u2019s our focus with the release of the MVP to the first 1,000 users. We will deal with all other priorities later.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/567/1*cstZKC-z9cwWAnDeiZdnmw.png\"><figcaption>Fig 5. <em>Representation drives strategy choice. In the above case, one could easily see the fears about lack of scalability as addressable but still opt for delivering a \u201cnon-scalable\u201d MVP to get early customer feedback before embarking on optimization for scalability.</em></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>So What Did I Learn from My Three Failed Attempts?</strong></h3>\n<p>Now, thanks to Wardley-Torok maps, I can show <strong>exactly</strong> what the issues were with my strategies. And of course, in hindsight, it all makes perfect\u00a0sense.</p>\n<p>In the first strategy (see Fig 6), I wrote down things that are all cool and would probably be the right steps for one company or another, but I totally missed understanding our company (i.e., what our value add is to our customers).</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8nbZP9FVwACnFkb6U2lQZQ.png\"><figcaption><em>Fig 6. Simplified Wardley-Torok maps of my three strategies. Dashed lines indicate the missing components. First (1) I just wrote up all cool and shiny things but didn\u2019t understand our value offering to customers deeply enough. Then (2) I understood the value offering and described an optimal target state of our capabilities but didn\u2019t write down how to get there. Finally (3), I collected all critical parts of our value chain and indicated the forces we have in the system, but I didn\u2019t specify which strategic choices about changes of direction we have to\u00a0make.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Then in the next one, I understood that correctly and even our specific value chain, but I mostly mapped the target states and not how to get there, which is a vision and not a strategy. Then, in my last one, I correctly mapped the dynamics and in some cases recognized that we should make some fine-tunings. But without the strategic actions, I just made a good snapshot of our organization\u2019s inertia. Luckily, from here you can see that I\u2019m very close to the actual strategy; it just took three months of work to get there without the mapping I described above. So I thought I would save you some time by just showing it to\u00a0you.</p>\n<p>This model is licensed CC BY-SA\u00a04.0</p>\n<p>Visit us at <a href=\"https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/\"><em>DataDrivenInvestor.com</em></a></p>\n<p>Subscribe to DDIntel\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ddintel.com/\"><em>here</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Join our creator ecosystem <a href=\"https://join.datadriveninvestor.com/\"><em>here</em></a>.</p>\n<p>DDI Official Telegram Channel: <a href=\"https://t.me/+tafUp6ecEys4YjQ1\">https://t.me/+tafUp6ecEys4YjQ1</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/data-driven-investor\"><em>LinkedIn</em></a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@DDInvestorHQ\"><em>Twitter</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/datadriveninvestor\"><em>YouTube</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/datadriveninvestor\"><em>Facebook</em></a>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=2e6232e4578f\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/how-to-draw-a-strategy-in-4-steps-2e6232e4578f\">How to Draw a Strategy in 4 Steps</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/\">DataDrivenInvestor</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n","enclosure":{},"categories":["strategy","storytelling","leadership","wardley-maps","management"]},{"title":"The Most Terrifying Game You Can Play with ChatGPT","pubDate":"2024-03-15 08:59:38","link":"https://generativeai.pub/the-most-terrifying-game-you-can-play-with-chatgpt-5075b7ee97e1?source=rss-798a10893c3e------2","guid":"https://medium.com/p/5075b7ee97e1","author":"\u00c1goston T\u00f6r\u00f6k","thumbnail":"","description":"\n<h4>I wanted to develop a fun party game but the first time testing it left me deeply unsettled</h4>\n<p>As a child, I was captivated by social deduction games like Mafia and Werewolf.

Think of the data we track on our navigation, our customer behavior, our health, and our company/team/individual performance. Unfortunately, this abundance of data led to a growing prevalence of KPI* psychosis in technology companies.</p>\n<p>What do I mean by this? Let\u2019s take the definition of<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/psychosis\"> Merriam-Webster</a> for psychosis: \u201ca serious mental illness characterized by defective or lost contact with reality\u201d. This means KPI psychosis is a state of mind where a company has dysfunctional contact with its reality and makes decisions only based on\u00a0numbers.</p>\n<h3>Human subjectivity</h3>\n<p>So why are companies so obsessed with collecting data to guide decisions? Data is seen as a way to fight biases, and when it comes to biases humans lead the way. We are so much biased that the people who collected the sorts of biases that feature human cognition<a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2002/press-release/\"> received a Nobel prize</a> for their\u00a0work.</p>\n<p>Just to give a glimpse: we take information that is easiest to gather (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic\">availability bias</a>), often that is heavily affected by the latest info we got (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_bias\">recency bias</a>) and when we make conclusions we tend to overgeneralize (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_effect\">halo/horn effect</a>) with more confidence than it was justified by our lintels (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconfidence_effect\">overconfidence bias</a>). On top, we are typically stubborn and seldom change our opinions and worldview (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_%28cognitive_bias%29\">anchoring bias</a>,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias\"> confirmation bias</a>). This is especially problematic when changes happen slowly and in small steps. For instance, the way software development productivity changes in our\u00a0team.</p>\n<h3>KPI objectivity</h3>\n<p>Enter KPIs as the objective truth. Free of subjectivity, perfect,\u00a0right?</p>\n<p>Not so fast. In fact, often our data collection and measurement are also biased by us (e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias\">algorithmic bias</a>). And even if that is not the case, unfortunately, KPIs suffer from tunnel vision: they measure what is measurable, while not necessarily all aspects of the situation are. Albert Einstein put it brilliantly:</p>\n<blockquote>\u201cEverything that can be counted does not necessarily count; everything that counts cannot necessarily be counted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p>This results in perverse motivation in many organizations, where people have to choose between doing their job well (broader reality) or getting promoted for meeting the KPIs (tunnel vision). And that\u2019s exactly the KPI psychosis I described above.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*r3MG5zr4zdqdUpchvv3c_A.jpeg\"><figcaption>KPIs are only indicators so they don\u2019t capture the full reality. Image with permission from <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/the_data_department\">https://www.reddit.com/user/the_data_department</a></figcaption></figure><h3>The trivial\u00a0solution</h3>\n<p>It takes a different mental framing to fix this situation: KPIs should be used in combination with human intuition to enable optimal decision-making. So not just intuition or data, but a constant back and forth of making (i.e. intuition) and testing (i.e. data) hypotheses.</p>\n<p>This leads us to the importance of explaining what a KPI actually indicates\u200a\u2014\u200aand not only what it measures. This is often underestimated. Let\u2019s take the example of Time To Last Byte (TTLB), a common metric of service quality that we also use at <a href=\"https://www.promaton.com/\">Promaton</a>. It measures the time between the request sent by the client and the last byte of the related response from the server. In business terms, this is how much time your customer has to wait to get what they want. It\u2019s easy to calculate and you can easily see how optimizing the runtime of server-side processing would result in improvement in the TTLB. However, you never actually want to improve TTLB per se, what you want to optimize is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drf5ZKd4aVY\">user experience</a>. And understanding this is essential.</p>\n<p>If you know that you care about user experience, it can easily happen that you start exploring first the user segment that suffers most from high TTLBs. Maybe you are going to see that these users have something in common, e.g. all those requests are from an area with poor internet connection. Now your course of action will not be optimization of server-side processing, but something else (e.g. deploying in that region or on-premise for those customers). And most importantly maybe this action could easily lead to a smaller overall TTLB improvement than optimizing the most time-consuming process in the backend, yet you clearly improved the user experience more.</p>\n<h3>Getting KPI optimization right</h3>\n<p>KPIs are not born perfect: they often require lots of conceptualization, trial-and-error learning, or redefinition before you find comfort in relying on them. So you work on reaching your objective and while doing so you constantly check both what your KPI shows and also how much you can rely on it. Let\u2019s say you want your product to be useful for your users in the long term. You start measuring retention, but there are so many conceptual challenges that you\u2019ll have to resolve before your KPI would be really correlated with the long-term usefulness of the product; e.g. things like who a user is and what long-term means. This is the process called KPI optimization.</p>\n<p>KPI optimization is not about selecting one such value, telling them it\u2019s bad, and telling your people to optimize it (e.g. our churn is 5%, it should be 2%). The problem with that is that it\u2019s going to discourage people from asking up to which level that number represents reality. Reality both from the validity (it measures actual user loss) and from the reliability (it reliably changes when user loss happens) point of\u00a0view.</p>\n<p>And finally, people are pretty good at number hacking: when I was about ten years old, I learned that secretly rubbing the mercury container of the thermometer helps to increase my \u201cmeasured\u201d body temperature. This was the KPI my mother used for deciding if I was (too) sick to go to school. Learning this hack helped me to score quite some extra holidays, but surely didn\u2019t help our family\u2019s objective of keeping kids at home (only) when they are\u00a0sick.</p>\n<p>To summarize, here are my recommendations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use KPIs in combination with intuition for optimal decision\u00a0making</li>\n<li>Always keep in mind your actual objective instead of only defining the\u00a0KPIs</li>\n<li>Continuously reflect on the reliability of your KPIs and revise them if necessary</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Btw, do you want to work in a company that does not suffer from KPI psychosis? Check out our open positions here: <a href=\"https://careers.promaton.com/\">https://careers.promaton.com/</a></p>\n<p>*: I use the acronym KPI (key performance indicator) instead of \u201cdata\u201d because I consider it advantageous to have the word \u201cindicator\u201d always in mind but think of all metrics, numbers, indices, key results\u00a0etc.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=5ffc83967f2b\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.promaton.com/how-to-avoid-kpi-psychosis-in-your-organization-5ffc83967f2b\">How to avoid KPI psychosis in your organization?</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://blog.promaton.com/\">Promaton</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n","content":"\n<h4>A practical guide to a good measurement culture where numbers don\u2019t replace common\u00a0sense</h4>\n<p>We live in a world where we collect data about everything.

This means KPI psychosis is a state of mind where a company has dysfunctional contact with its reality and makes decisions only based on\u00a0numbers.</p>\n<h3>Human subjectivity</h3>\n<p>So why are companies so obsessed with collecting data to guide decisions? Data is seen as a way to fight biases, and when it comes to biases humans lead the way. We are so much biased that the people who collected the sorts of biases that feature human cognition<a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2002/press-release/\"> received a Nobel prize</a> for their\u00a0work.</p>\n<p>Just to give a glimpse: we take information that is easiest to gather (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic\">availability bias</a>), often that is heavily affected by the latest info we got (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_bias\">recency bias</a>) and when we make conclusions we tend to overgeneralize (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_effect\">halo/horn effect</a>) with more confidence than it was justified by our lintels (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconfidence_effect\">overconfidence bias</a>). On top, we are typically stubborn and seldom change our opinions and worldview (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_%28cognitive_bias%29\">anchoring bias</a>,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias\"> confirmation bias</a>). This is especially problematic when changes happen slowly and in small steps. For instance, the way software development productivity changes in our\u00a0team.</p>\n<h3>KPI objectivity</h3>\n<p>Enter KPIs as the objective truth. Free of subjectivity, perfect,\u00a0right?</p>\n<p>Not so fast. In fact, often our data collection and measurement are also biased by us (e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias\">algorithmic bias</a>). And even if that is not the case, unfortunately, KPIs suffer from tunnel vision: they measure what is measurable, while not necessarily all aspects of the situation are. Albert Einstein put it brilliantly:</p>\n<blockquote>\u201cEverything that can be counted does not necessarily count; everything that counts cannot necessarily be counted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p>This results in perverse motivation in many organizations, where people have to choose between doing their job well (broader reality) or getting promoted for meeting the KPIs (tunnel vision). And that\u2019s exactly the KPI psychosis I described above.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*r3MG5zr4zdqdUpchvv3c_A.jpeg\"><figcaption>KPIs are only indicators so they don\u2019t capture the full reality. Image with permission from <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/the_data_department\">https://www.reddit.com/user/the_data_department</a></figcaption></figure><h3>The trivial\u00a0solution</h3>\n<p>It takes a different mental framing to fix this situation: KPIs should be used in combination with human intuition to enable optimal decision-making. So not just intuition or data, but a constant back and forth of making (i.e. intuition) and testing (i.e. data) hypotheses.</p>\n<p>This leads us to the importance of explaining what a KPI actually indicates\u200a\u2014\u200aand not only what it measures. This is often underestimated. Let\u2019s take the example of Time To Last Byte (TTLB), a common metric of service quality that we also use at <a href=\"https://www.promaton.com/\">Promaton</a>. It measures the time between the request sent by the client and the last byte of the related response from the server. In business terms, this is how much time your customer has to wait to get what they want. It\u2019s easy to calculate and you can easily see how optimizing the runtime of server-side processing would result in improvement in the TTLB. However, you never actually want to improve TTLB per se, what you want to optimize is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drf5ZKd4aVY\">user experience</a>. And understanding this is essential.</p>\n<p>If you know that you care about user experience, it can easily happen that you start exploring first the user segment that suffers most from high TTLBs. Maybe you are going to see that these users have something in common, e.g. all those requests are from an area with poor internet connection. Now your course of action will not be optimization of server-side processing, but something else (e.g. deploying in that region or on-premise for those customers). And most importantly maybe this action could easily lead to a smaller overall TTLB improvement than optimizing the most time-consuming process in the backend, yet you clearly improved the user experience more.</p>\n<h3>Getting KPI optimization right</h3>\n<p>KPIs are not born perfect: they often require lots of conceptualization, trial-and-error learning, or redefinition before you find comfort in relying on them. So you work on reaching your objective and while doing so you constantly check both what your KPI shows and also how much you can rely on it. Let\u2019s say you want your product to be useful for your users in the long term. You start measuring retention, but there are so many conceptual challenges that you\u2019ll have to resolve before your KPI would be really correlated with the long-term usefulness of the product; e.g. things like who a user is and what long-term means. This is the process called KPI optimization.</p>\n<p>KPI optimization is not about selecting one such value, telling them it\u2019s bad, and telling your people to optimize it (e.g. our churn is 5%, it should be 2%). The problem with that is that it\u2019s going to discourage people from asking up to which level that number represents reality. Reality both from the validity (it measures actual user loss) and from the reliability (it reliably changes when user loss happens) point of\u00a0view.</p>\n<p>And finally, people are pretty good at number hacking: when I was about ten years old, I learned that secretly rubbing the mercury container of the thermometer helps to increase my \u201cmeasured\u201d body temperature. This was the KPI my mother used for deciding if I was (too) sick to go to school. Learning this hack helped me to score quite some extra holidays, but surely didn\u2019t help our family\u2019s objective of keeping kids at home (only) when they are\u00a0sick.</p>\n<p>To summarize, here are my recommendations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use KPIs in combination with intuition for optimal decision\u00a0making</li>\n<li>Always keep in mind your actual objective instead of only defining the\u00a0KPIs</li>\n<li>Continuously reflect on the reliability of your KPIs and revise them if necessary</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Btw, do you want to work in a company that does not suffer from KPI psychosis? Check out our open positions here: <a href=\"https://careers.promaton.com/\">https://careers.promaton.com/</a></p>\n<p>*: I use the acronym KPI (key performance indicator) instead of \u201cdata\u201d because I consider it advantageous to have the word \u201cindicator\u201d always in mind but think of all metrics, numbers, indices, key results\u00a0etc.</p>\n<img
