I was honored to be invited by the Ambassador of Sweeden, <a href="http://www.swedenabroad.com/hu-HU/Embassies/Budapest/Rolunk/A-Nagykovet/">H.E. Niclas Trouvé</a> to the annual buffet dinner celebrating the Nobel Prize Award. I met many great researchers during the eve, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Lov%C3%A1sz">László Lovász</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endre_Szemer%C3%A9di">Endre Szemerédi</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Istv%C3%A1n-Hargittai/e/B001IR1P7G">István Hargittai</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_B%C3%A1r%C3%A1ny">Anders Bárány</a> (the grandson of Robert von Bárány) just to name a few.

Because I'm doing research on the interplay of vision and the vestibular system, I didn't miss the opportunity to share Anders how happy I was when everyone knew at UCL the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B3bert_B%C3%A1r%C3%A1ny">Robert von Bárány</a>, the man who discovered the vestibular system.
