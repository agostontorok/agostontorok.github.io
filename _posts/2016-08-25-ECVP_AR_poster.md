I'm traveling to Barcelona to visit the [ECVP2016](http://www.ub.edu/ecvp/programme), where I continue my mission on AR evangelism. I learnt a couple things from the [ICOM6](http://www.icom2016.com/) that made this poster a better shot.

I noticed that some people didn't know what to do with my poster, they were standing in front of it and did not find its [affordance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance). Also, I was studying which graphical features attracted the most people. Based on this I realized that it was not a good idea to minimize color use on headlines. On this poster, in reaction to these, I changed two things:
* I added red headlines to attract attention to my work. 
* I completely removed the figures to facilitate affordance (I bring a version w/ pictures for handouts)
* I added animations instead of static pictures, this way one could understand my results in 15 sec (measured)

Final words: I brought a surprising and new result to the conference: People reorient very quickly in a known environment (~100 msec), and the unseen spatial information modulates visual processing from early stages. If you read this before, let's meet at my poster on Monday, if not I hope that the visual effects brought you there and you learnt about a rather interesting part of spatial research. Cheers!
