Next week is going to be a little bit busy in research, we can meet at several events:

- I'm going to give a short talk on emotion recognition on the [NLP meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Hungarian-nlp/events/234237929/) at [Meltwater HQRS](https://www.google.hu/maps/place/Meltwater+Kft./@47.4932626,19.0578452,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x93f82a7d14ca60ac?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwid_t2Y67bPAhXH1xQKHYwtDsoQ_BIIggEwCw) on 5 Oct.
- During the next two days, I'm visiting the [Crunch conference](http://crunchconf.com/) with our new data engineer, Dani. 
- And the weekend is going to be two days of hacking the brain at the [SMC Brain Hackathon](http://sites.ieee.org/sb-westminster/2016/07/06/ieee-smc-brain-computer-interface-hackathon/), with the great team of [Tomi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamas-nagy-549bbb42), [Norbi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/norbertmajubu), [Balázs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/balázs-jáger-629b0385), and [Dani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dániel-pálma-0391b2106).
