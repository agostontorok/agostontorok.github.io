I gave a talk to a brilliant audience yesterday at the [NLP meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Hungarian-nlp/events/234237929/). My slides on what we do at Synetiq are available [here](http://agostontorok.github.io/research/nlp_meetup_synetiq_mediaresearch) made in [Slides of loci](https://github.com/agostontorok/slides-of-loci). If you are wondering what that is: it a 3D capable presentation tool I made to design functional and effective 3D enabled presentations. You can read more about the philosophy [here](https://github.com/agostontorok/slides-of-loci#-slides-of-loci-).
