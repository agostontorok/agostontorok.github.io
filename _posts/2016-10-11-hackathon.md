So we have won the Qusp Prize at the largest Brain Hackathon :)

Our winning solution, [which can be found on github](https://github.com/Synetiq/ieee-brain-hackathon-2016), was a Tunnel game, where the environment changed to optimize performance based on brain signals. Although we did not reach the full potential - e.g. the deep learning part and the HTC VIVE were not integrated into the setup - we strive to finish it next time. I was very happy to have this great team: Jovanka, Balazs, Tomi, Dani, and Norbi all done a very good job and we had lots of fun in this 36 hours.
