I'm giving a talk at the [CogInfoCom 2016](http://www.coginfocom.hu/conference/CogInfoCom16/). My slides on what I see as the future of HCI can be seen [here](http://agostontorok.github.io/research/coginfocom2016) made in [Slides of loci](https://github.com/agostontorok/slides-of-loci). The paper which the presentation is based on can be [read here on your request](/public/files/CogInfoCom_2016_paper_80.pdf).

I'm very happy to be here and discuss these things with the [Maxwhere team](http://www.maxwhere.com/), which develops Maxwhere Seminar an interactive 3D presentation tool I can't wait check out.
