I gave a talk at the [Budapest BI Forum 2016](http://budapestbiforum.hu/2016/hu/#eloadok). This was one the best events I've been to this year, respect to the organizers. The talk was about how to communicate data science results to the management. This has been an ongoing challenge for me, so I was happy to share some tips based on my experiences. You can have a look at the slides yourself [here](http://agostontorok.github.io/research/how_to_tell_your_results/#/1).
