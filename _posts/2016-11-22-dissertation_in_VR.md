While I was preparing for the [PhD defense](http://agostontorok.github.io/research/torok_agoston_thesis.pdf), I figured these experiments would be more easy to understand if one can even be there. Luckily, this can now be easily solved with the [Google Cardboard SDK](https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/) and Unity 3D. So here is my [Doctoral dissertation in VR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Torok.Dissertation) :)

You only need an Android phone and a Cardboard to run it, also you can try it after the Viva on the spot.
