So this is a big day: our chapter on Cognitive Data Visualization has been published in the series Topics in Intelligent Engineering and Informatics. Aaand... this is the first time that my work can be found in [books.google.com](https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=a8hqDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA49&ots=Fg_RZz0mHt&sig=Xs9DOaf4afTlkaYvc5LVzJ5ISaM#v=onepage&q&f=false) :) 

The chapter is also - historically - the first work I co-authored with my dad. It was a very interesting experience to work together on this and this is reflected from the title to the end of the chapter. It's also terrific to think about that it took 25 years of studying and knowledge gathering on my end to get to this point.
