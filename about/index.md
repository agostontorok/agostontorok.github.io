Hello, My name is Agoston Torok. I'm a [Director of Data Science at AGT International](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vataVq9gY_o&t=190s). Our tech powers startups, looking at new ways of using AI and help them raising investments from prominent players, such as [Softbank](https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/02/heed-softbank/) or [DFL](https://www.dfl.de/en/news/next-step-of-dfl-for-equity-investment-strategy-dfl-acquires-shares-in-movez-a-mobile-app-start-up-for-ball-games-and-football-skills-evaluation/). I'm working on doing data science beyond the hype: developing statistics & machine learning solutions using software development (Lean, TDD) best practices to build easy-to-deploy and easy-to-extend features.  

I did my doctoral studies at ELTE (Budapest, Hungary). I worked at two prestigious research institutes of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences: at the [Brain Imaging Centre](http://www.ttk.hu/akk/en/) and the [Insitute of Computer Science and Control](https://www.sztaki.hu/innovacio/hirek/mesterseges-intelligencia-nem-kell-felni-meg) (also known as SZTAKI). My research focused on using new developments in computing (mixed reality, machine learning) to help research in neuroscience. I was part of the research team that first recorded individual [grid cells in the human brain](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/114/17/E3516.full.pdf) and showed how those are different from the rodent analogues.  In another project, we showed the [neural evidence for why virtual teleportation is a natural way of locomotion in VR](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304394018308164?via%3Dihub). I carried out exciting research projects at several universities with some of the best researchers out there: [studied distance illusions at UCL](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0169990), Mars gravity perception at [Royal Holloway University](https://vemerhul1.wixsite.com/vemerhul/people), and e.g. rapid multisensory perception at [Aix-Marseille University](http://crvm.ism.univ-amu.fr/actualites_realite_virtuelle_3.html).

As time went by, my focus turned to how we can apply research results to create better products. First, I led the [R&D team at Synetiq](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Nl8Y2y2jgk) and took part in the development of their long-running tracking study. Then, I joined AGT International to take the lead of a truly unique team of data scientists. Nowadays, instead of research papers, I blog on [medium](https://medium.com/@torokagoston) about practices, challenges, and people perspectives of a data science team.

Some fun facts: I designed my own [3D presentation toolkit](https://github.com/agostontorok/slides-of-loci), I have a gift to find the people who like talking about science in basically every pub around the world, and I love visiting skyscrapers.

If you are interested in more details, have a look at [my resume](/about/agostontorok_cv_eng_co.pdf) and my publications on [google scholar](https://scholar.google.hu/citations?user=bhZeGh4AAAAJ&hl=hu).
