Hello, My name is Agoston Torok. 

I write here and on [medium](https://medium.com/@torokagoston) about leadership challenges and doing AI beyond the hype: developing statistics & machine learning solutions using software development (Lean, TDD) best practices to build maintainable software and useful products. I'm CTO at [Promaton](https://www.promaton.com/), changing dental treatment planning in the here and now. 

By the way, I was the creator of [The Data Department](https://www.instagram.com/tddcomics/), a cartoon series about data science and tech development and recently started board game development too.

That's it... 

Are you still here? Ok, then a few things about how I got here :)

I did my doctoral studies at ELTE (Budapest, Hungary). I worked at two prestigious research institutes of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences: at the [Brain Imaging Centre](http://www.ttk.hu/akk/en/) and the [Insitute of Computer Science and Control](https://www.sztaki.hu/innovacio/hirek/mesterseges-intelligencia-nem-kell-felni-meg) (also known as SZTAKI). My research focused on using new developments in computing (mixed reality, machine learning) to help research in neuroscience. I was part of the research team that first recorded individual [grid cells in the human brain](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/17/E3516) and showed how those are different from the rodent analogues. 

In another project, we showed the [neural evidence for why virtual teleportation is a natural way of locomotion in VR](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304394018308164?via%3Dihub). During my doctoral studies, I travelled a lot. I carried out exciting research projects at several universities with some of the best researchers out there: [studied distance illusions at UCL](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0169990), Mars gravity perception at [Royal Holloway University](https://vemerhul1.wixsite.com/vemerhul/people), and e.g. rapid multisensory perception at [Aix-Marseille University](http://crvm.ism.univ-amu.fr/actualites_realite_virtuelle_3.html).

As time went by, my focus turned to how we can apply research results to create better products. I was fortunate to join [Synetiq](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Nl8Y2y2jgk) and lead their R&D team. We created a fully-automated data analysis pipeline turning eye-tracking, heart rate, galvanic skin response and EEG signals into testable and objective marketing insights. This pipeline is still the basis of their record-long-running tracking study. 

And finally, some fun facts: long time ago I designed my own [3D presentation toolkit](https://github.com/agostontorok/slides-of-loci), I play cricket, and I love visiting skyscrapers.
