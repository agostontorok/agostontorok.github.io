Hello, My name is Agoston Torok. 

I did my doctoral studies at ELTE (Budapest, Hungary). I worked at two prestigious research institutes of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences: at the [Brain Imaging Centre](http://www.ttk.mta.hu/telefonkonyv/torok-agoston/) and at the [Insitute of Computer Science and Control](https://www.sztaki.hu/en/agoston-zsolt-torok) (also known as SZTAKI). 

My interest was using new developments in computing (mixed reality, machine learning) to help research in neuroscience. I was part of the research team that first recorded individual [grid cells in the human brain](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/114/17/E3516.full.pdf) and showed how those are different from the rodent analogues. 

Later, I studied also how neuroscience can help the design of [better user interfaces](https://agostontorok.github.io/public/files/CogInfoCom_2016_paper_80.pdf). Amongst other things, We showed that the [neural underpinnings of why virtual teleportation is a good way of locomotion in VR](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304394018308164?via%3Dihub). I carried out research projects at several universities: studied distance illusions at UCL, Mars gravity perception at [Royal Holloway University](https://vemerhul1.wixsite.com/vemerhul/people), and e.g. rapid perception at [Aix-Marseille University](http://crvm.ism.univ-amu.fr/actualites_realite_virtuelle_3.html). 

As time went by, my focus turned to how applied research can serve masses. First, I lead the [R&D team at Synetiq](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Nl8Y2y2jgk) and now I'm a [lead data scientist at AGT International](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vataVq9gY_o&t=190s). My focus is on doing data science beyond the hype: applying statistics & machine learning (RL, DL) with software development (Lean, XP) best practices to bring promises to reality. You can read many related post on my blog here or on [medium](https://medium.com/@torokagoston). Recently, the outputs of my work are improving features of the [HEED sport storytelling app](https://heedlive.com/).

Some fun facts: I designed my own [3D presentation toolkit](https://github.com/agostontorok/slides-of-loci), I have a gift to find the people who like talking about science in basically every pub around the world, and I love visiting skyscrapers.
