Over the past decade, I have had the privilege of collaborating with some great art valuation experts in the field. I've learned a lot from them and managed to combine my own experience in AI with their insights in the intricate processes of authenticating artworks and tracing their provenance. Since these works are typically reside in private collections, confidentiality agreements limit the specifics I can disclose, I am eager to share the broad strokes.
