    Working on AI products — Whether it is retail, IoT, or marketing — data scientists face similar challenges. Some of these challenges are general to many technology areas, others are specific to AI, due to its unique way this field blurs the boundaries between state-of-the-art research and application development. Let’s look at three prototypical examples of these challenges in the areas of business specification, iterative development of analytics, and testing.

    I joined this field because of the excitement that we feel upon discovering new patterns in data. With time though, it became clear that identifying patterns is just the first half of this journey. There is another part, which is about sharing this discovery. ‘Sharing’ can be in the form of a presentation, in the form of a change in an existing product or even an entirely new product. Thus the two parts together — nurturing ideas from inception to a product — is the full stack of data science.

    After the first part of this mini-series, I received some very interesting insights from fellow data professionals. Interestingly, one of the recurring topics was talent management. This topic is also very close to me. I know from first-hand experience that without good mentors and talent management I would never have been able to get to this point and still enjoy so much my everyday work. In this article, I would like to discuss the two specific aspects of talent management. The first is nurturing talent during internships and the second is whether a computer science dropout or a fresh PhD is better material for a data scientist.

    This is the first part of a mini-series that summarizes my impressions on what makes certain data science teams effective. Over the years, I have worked in several teams: teams of various sizes, from as small as a duo to as large as a dozen data experts; and of various players, from college dropout savants through rebranded software engineers to PhD/postdocs with long years of academic experience. My role was also changing, I started as a junior and with time and experience developed to be a team lead.

    Developing a data science product is the focus of many startups and enterprises in our time. Thousands of entrepreneurs are working on finding a way to create a better world or to make huge money. They all want to do this by using current developments in machine learning, data storage, cloud computing, and deep learning. Although many products are built on technology, data-driven products are unique since here the research results of last week may end up in a product already next month. And that is fast. The field is, therefore, filled with noise and buzz…

    For almost ten years, every year on Christmas Eve, my mum took us in the car and drove to an old house in our village. We brought carefully wrapped toys and food to a family in need. She told us that the parents are very nice people and have children who are our age. Since this was a small village, I once asked my mum, <em>“Do I know the children?”</em> My mum looked at me and said, <em>“I don’t think so, you know people in need only if you look for them.”</em>

    About five years ago, we have come up with a idea about grid cells that challenged mainstream scientific thinking. While grid cells in rodent form a context independent coordinate system for spatial navigation, we thought that their activity actually does depend on the context in humans. To verify this we designed an experiment where epliepsy patients with implanted electrodes had to navigate in virtual environments of different sizes.

    In recent times the popularity of Bayesian statistics has greatly increased, thanks to the large computing power of modern computers. As a result, there is an ongoing debate on whether the Bayesian or frequentist approach is more suitable for statistical and scientific purposes. A great number of introductory papers on these two schools of statistical inference are available online, therefore I will not spend time reiterating the basic definitions here (for those who are interested I recommend <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/MIT18_05S14_Reading20.pdf">these</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160110224503/http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~brani/isyebayes/bank/lindleybayeslady.pdf">two</a> documents, which contain excellent introductions to the topic). Instead, my goal is to take a look at which of these two approaches is worth following in order to reach the right statistical conclusions – whatever the definition of ‘right’ may be.

    I’ve just returned from pilot testing in the VeME lab directed by <a href="https://vemerhul.wordpress.com/people-2/">Elisa Ferré</a> at Royal Holloway, University of London thanks to my <a href="http://www.eps.ac.uk/index.php/grants-and-awards">EPS grant</a>. We are studying how vestibular and visual informations interact in the perception of gravity. We focus the current experiment on the dynamic nature of gravity, namely the perception of moving objects.

    So here we are: another great year is ending tomorrow. During the Christmas period I looked back to what happened in 2016, despite the phenomenal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMkgEucahAo">John Oliver wrap up</a>, I’m pretty happy with my achievements this year. First I wanted to write a long post about what I am proud of and thankful for, then I realized that in this case a picture indeed tells more than 10^2 words. So here is my 2016 infographic.
