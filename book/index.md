For the past 8 years, I've been leading people in AI research and development.

These roles helped me to collect some practical insights into how one could best tackle the complexity of doing **research on short timelines** and **yielding products** that are useful in the real world AND doing this in an environment where **people feel good** about themselves and their work.

I'm working on a book that is intended for people who are in similar situations. I'm not sure if it's a good idea yet, but it's a great opportunity to share my experience with the world. The book is similar to the content I'm sharing on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agoston-torok/recent-activity/all/) page.
