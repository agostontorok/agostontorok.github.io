Have you ever read a book that is intended for data scientists and it's not about how GANs work but about all the **vital soft skills** in our highly technical field? Questions such as how to connect forming business ideas to algorithms? How to motivate people who struggle with notorious data issues day in-day out? 

No, right? Well, **this is the book for you** then.

No dry descriptions of theories, just **real-life stories** about how to not fail, how to ask for help, how to keep going in a team.
