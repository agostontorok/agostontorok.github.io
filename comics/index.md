I'm the creator of **The Data Department comics**, more famously known as **tddcomics**, which features the extraordinary adventures of John and his team in the department of cloud-based data-driven AI-enabled magic.

Over time some of these comics reached hundreds of thousands of readers, collected thousands of interactions, almost ten thousand followers, and gained zero $ revenue ;)
