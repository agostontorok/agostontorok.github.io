I'm working on two games at the moment:

[Murder Mystery Ultimate](murdermysteryultimate): a fun party game that provides the ultimate detective experience without deception and scripts. For 3-6 players, 12yrs+ and takes 30-45 min.

[Robot Detective](https://poe.com/RobotDetectiveGame): an unsettling, dystopic party game with ChatGPT about how life would be with robot detectives trying to solve crimes today. For 2-6 players, 12yrs+ and takes 10-15 min.
