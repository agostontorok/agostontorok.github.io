## Navigation

We don't see space, we feel it instead. This was a consequence of the experiments of John O'Keefe and Jonathan Dostrovsky in 1971, when they found place cells in a rat's hippocampus, far from the visual cortex. Those cells fired each time when the rat was at certain places in the experimental box. Their discovery inspired several new experiments on how we navigate in space. I'm interested in how we can address new questions on this topic using virtual reality. I'm lucky to collaborate on these with researchers from MTA SZTAKI, BME, Technion (Haifa, Israel) and UT Austin (Texas, USA).

## Multimodal integration

With the growing interest in Virtual Reality applications it's essential to reveal how the brain perceives it. Multisensory integration is highly relevant from this aspect. This is due to the fact that in VR environments we experience a paradox situation. On one hand, no matter how realistic the scene is, we know it is virtual; but on the other hand, even modest virtual scenes are capable of evoking strange experiencies, e.g. vertigo by simply rocking the horizon. It is still an open question in which level of cognitive processing we perceive virtual reality as real, and in which level our brain knows that it is not. I'm currently collaborating with researchers from Aix-Marseille University (France), UCL (London, UK) and Carl von Ossietzky University (Oldenburg, Germany).

## The prosodic structure

Our ancestors spoke. They did not write or read, but spoke with an evolving grammar and prosody to express their thoughts, emotions and beliefs. And as our thoughts are complicated sometimes it is also hard to tell them: speech needs a structure. We could simply grab the basis of structure by stating that it's important to know what words belong together and what words reflect the point of the conversation. In prosody these two structural aims are served by two abstract representations, namely the prosodic boundary and the prominence. In my research I'm looking for the characteristics of how the brain perceives the utterances in the real world. Because it is also important to know that under normal circumstances we seldom use "well" all the necessary markers of these elements, however we do understand each other almost perfectly.
