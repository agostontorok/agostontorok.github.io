In the past, I've given talks at conferences and meetups about AI, leadership, and software development. These days, I'm mostly sharing my experiences in more exclusive settings.

## Want me to speak at your event?

I'm always happy to share my experiences and insights about:
- Building and leading AI teams
- Developing AI products
- Machine learning in production
- Lean data science practices

Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agoston-torok/) to discuss speaking opportunities.
